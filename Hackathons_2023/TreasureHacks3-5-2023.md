# Treasure Hacks 3.5
 
**April 28 - 30, 2023** 
**Treasure Hacks**
**(Online) United States, California, Irvine**  

## Event Summary

Treasure Hacks 3.5 was a 32-hour Online Generative AI and Blockchain event that encouraged beginners to explore and build we these topics.
By hosting a General Hacks category (students can build anything), we hoped to attract students who wanted to create a
general project. Then, once signed up, we hoped to convince people to build with Generative AI and Blockchain through
our multiple workshops covering the basics of coding with these topics. These workshops included things like:
- ChatGPT Workshop
- Verbwire Workshop (Made it easy to develop in the blockchain)
- Expert Q&As
- Speakers talking about the themes as a whole.

GitHub was featured through our special GitHub 101 workshop which was hosted by one of our teammembers before the event. We wanted to
make sure that everyone could start coding right away at the beginning of the hackathon and we believe this starts with creating
a GitHub.

## Event Metrics 

| Attendees |First Time Hackers| Projects|
|---------------:|--------------:|------------:|
|{150}|{68}|[{54}]([https://treasurehacks-3-5.devpost.com/project-gallery])| 

I'm shocked at the attendees to projects ratio :O

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

Sign-ups from 33 different countries with the largest amounts being from the US (183), India (143), 52 (Canada), 8 (Brazil)

### Hacker demographics
- Our target audience was high school (138) & college (188) students, but we had sign-ups from from an amazing 6-year old to students 
from coding schools.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the GitHub funds to market the event (through campaigns and hiring freelancers), high capacity discord channels to host 
workshops/opening & closing ceremonies, and prizes.
- Without these funds, we probably wouldn't have reached as many different diverse groups nor have had prizes to encourage collaboration such
as our "Most Helpful" award which awards the participant who has answered the most questions/helped the most students with their projects.

## Top Projects

### Best Generative AI Hack

**Sight Sense**
[Project](https://devpost.com/software/sightsense)
Your Third Eye - Empowering the visually impaired

Absolutely blew us away with the presentation production and also the product itself. Their product was an amazing
hardware hack even while being online. Probably one of the more jaw-dropping projects we've ever had.
We also helped them with their logo with our "Custom Logo Creation" event where our lead designer drew logos for everyone.

### Best Blockchain Hack

**Gatery**
[Project](https://devpost.com/software/gatery)
Create NFT tokengated content experiences for anything

The participant developed something that I've only recently seen at the beginnings of being developed by a company
I follow, and he created it in just a weekend! I was shocked about how polished it was and the flawless functions
it presented. He's also a longtime Treasure Hacks community member and it was truly a joy seeing him grow.

### Best General Hack

**Exam Gazette**
[Project](https://devpost.com/software/examgazette)
Stay ahead in the academic game with ExamsGazette. We list all upcoming exams, notify you of opportunities and 
offer study materials to maximize your chances of success. Simplify your exam prep today.

The wide spread of different career based pathways that were laid out in this project was pretty cool. Wish I
had something like this at the beginning of college ðŸ’€.

### Our Favorite Hack (From the 6-year old)

**Recycling and storytelling come alive!**
[Project][(https://devpost.com/software/recycling-and-storytelling-come-alive)]
Idea is to merge 2 interesting games, i.e. recycling quiz & a word association or Madlib game, 
the project helps to learn about recycling & the environment more fun and interactive like an AI bot.

Our judges loved her and had all sorts of nice feedback for her.

It was her first time using GitHub so one of our teammates went onto a call to teacher her 1-on-1.

Unfortunately since we are an online hackathon, we didn't take any photos ;-;

## Whatâ€™s Next?

- We learned a ton from this event, specifically in regards to online mentorship. We tried to partner
with another coding discord to provide more quality mentorship to our participants but the system
was unfinished and we ended up having to improvise a lot. Next event we have a ton of plans to 
make mentoring online better for both the mentors and the participants.
We also learned that we should lower our attendence expectations for themed hackathons (especially one with
an intimidating topics such as Generative AI and Blockchain).

- We plan to host an in-person hackathon in the San Diego area around January 19-21, it'll be our first
online hackathon as a team and we're super excited for it!
