# Power Up Hacks 2022
 <br>
 
#### March 18 - 20, 2022 
#### Major League Hacking University
#### New York City, NY, USA  

## Event Summary

Power Up Hacks was 48 hours of hacking, helping our audience grow their career skills, and work towards their first job or internship. We saw hundreds of hackers from all over the world join us for a variety of mini-events, workshops, and other programming to help them Power Up.
<br>
Throughout the weekend hackers were encouraged to work on projects that would help them or their fellow hackers be more prepared for their first job or internship. There’s a summary of some of our top projects down below. Beyond just hacking though, our team coordinated other activities for hackers too. Our resume roast was a huge success. Hackers would share their resume and receive live friendly feedback from an audience. We helped hackers prepare for both their demos and interviews by running slideshow karaoke where they presented on a brand new topic.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
Power Up Hacks targeted hackers from underrepresented backgrounds looking to get started on their careers in tech. Over 50% of the attendees were relatively new to coding and benefitted from their attendance at Power Up Hacks. We provided a community of support and resources necessary to succeed. We had a gender parity of 60% women and 40% men as one of our focuses was to elevate women in the tech space.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Our team would not have been able to host our event without the help of the GitHub Grant. It was really a great relief when we were struggling for funding, and it ultimately allowed us to support more hackers than we expected. Ultimately, we spent our grant money on a healthy dinner for our hackers Saturday night.
